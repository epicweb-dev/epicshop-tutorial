# Epic Workshop App Tutorial 👨‍🏫

👨‍💼 Welcome to the Epic Workshop App Tutorial! My name is Peter the Product
Manager! My job is to communicate user requirements to you as you work through
workshop exercises. My goal is to help you understand how what you're learning
is applicable to real-world problems.

In Epic Workshops, this is the homepage and it will give you an overview of what
to expect to learn in the workshop.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the features of the app to make sure you're
aware of what is available to help you learn and succeed in the workshop. And
we'll be using the workshop app itself to do it!
